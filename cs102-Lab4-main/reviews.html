                    <p>So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences
                        for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of
                        trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a
                        child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.
                    </p>
                    <p>And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2
                        minutes.</p>
                    <p>And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had
                        to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in
                        order to imagine some fake imaginary children.</p>
                    <p>It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense...
                        Pretty meh overall, and I stopped paying attention during some parts as I was thinking about
                        other things because it was not engaging at all.</p>

                    <p>Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse
                        of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a
                        strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness.
                        Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are
                        inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its
                        own.</p>

                    <p>Call it a magnum opus, or larger than life, but Vikram has been worth the wait. A Kamal Haasan
                        film always brings innovation with it, and Vikram aces it in action. Mounted on superlative
                        production values and a breathtaking pace, Vikram doesn't have one dull moment in its 146
                        minutes of running time
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The film starts with a series of murders, including that of Karan (Kamal Haasan) perpetrated by
                        a team of vigilantes that claims to be cleaning up the system by waging a war against the
                        system. Two of the three people murdered were policemen who had captured a large consignment of
                        drugs and hidden the same in an unknown place, and Karan was the foster father of one of them.
                        This is just the beginning. The Chennai Police Commissioner calls upon a crack team of sleuths
                        led by Amar (Fahadh Faasil) to trace down the culprits as they are the best in the business.
                        Amar and team go about systematically and conclude the case with a warning to the Commissioner
                        himself - that Amar knew who murdered one of the two policemen, and that Vikram, the original
                        leader of the Black Squad from the 1980s, taken for dead, is back to life and out on a mission
                        to rid the nation of the drug menace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vikram (Kamal Haasan) is in reality an undercover agent leading a team of vigilantes, cleaning
                        up drug mercenaries knowing very well that their current crop of antagonists headed by a local
                        drug lord Chandhan (Vijay Sethupati) are just small fish that must be dealt with. The real big
                        fish Rolex is who their ultimate aim is.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vikram, helmed by Lokesh Kanagaraj is visually spectacular. A taut action adventure, it extracts
                        Kamal Haasan to his fullest potential, but doesn't showcase him in every frame to make
                        sufficient space for Fahadh Faasil and Vijay Sethupati too. In fact, the three men are the core
                        of Vikram, in very different roles that make the movie immensely watchable with a mix of myriad
                        emotions and action at its best. The climax is violent, with the use of an arsenal of firearms
                        and hand to hand combat, setting up a finger licking wait for the potential sequel where Vikram
                        will lock horns with Rolex (Suriya, playing a surprise cameo). Don't wait for Vikram to drop
                        into OTT platforms, for a film like this must only be watched in the theatres.

                    <p> I watched RRR (Rise, Roar, Revolt)movie made with a budget of 500 crores.
                        It's a visual treat. S S Rajamoulis another gem of a movie after Bahubali.
                        It is a fictional story about two Indian revolutionaries, Alluri Sitarama Raju (Charan) and Komaram Bheem (jnr NTR ), who fought against the British Raj 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Aull action-packed movie.Action sequences are the best directed by renowned Hollywood action director Nick Powell..
                        Cinematography by K senthil kumar was mind-blowing. BGM by M M keeravani was good .</p>
                    <p>Jnr NTR  also supported well, and both have got equal importance in the movie.
                        Alia Bhatt, Ajay Devgan , and samuthirakani all supported well and gave full justice to their characters played.
                        Even the English actors were brilliant. </p>

                    <p>This is one of the greatest movies in Film History. I only give 5/5 stars for exceptional acting, editing, effects, and CGI. I really enjoyed the movie 
                        and I really appreciate  DVV entertainments for producing this movie along with crew, Ram Charan, NTR Jr., Ajay Devgan, Alia Bhatt, Olivia Morris, and Ray Steven. 
                        Ram Charan played Alluri Seeta Rama Raju very well and I really enjoyed how they creatively made a story on how he revolted against the Tyrannical British. 
                        I really loved NTR as Bheem and how they incorporated lots of historical facts about how he was part of the Gond Tribe 
                        and part of the Komura Clan which was well incorporated. I also loved the contrast between him being a revolutionary and a tribal and that made his character come alive</p>

                        I guess that’s what has worked for this magical masterpiece on screen. 
                    </p>
                    <p>This is a romantic coming of age story of Arun Neelakandan (beautifully essayed by Pranav Mohanlal) and how his life transpires through various People he meets, incidents that happened in his life and off course his love interest shape him as a person.
                        Ok I know it’s a regular coming of age story we have seen in so many movies of similar genre, that’s easy and said but Director Vineeth Sreenivasan makes sure he delivers his mark in this soulful tale that unfolds on big screen leaves all your emotions turned.   
                        This close to 3 hours long movie might sound like a long affair to sit and watch but a quirky and engaging screenplay makes sure mostly you don’t get that thought.</p>
                    <p>Performances – All three leads deliver what’s exactly needed for the role they look naturally the character which is a testimony to their craft. Pranav Mohanlal as Arun emoted almost every node of the emotional graph and gave his character life. Darshana Rajendran plays Darshana a beautiful curly

                    <p>"I see what you're going for, but it's not really working." This was my feeling numerous times during this movie. So many things feel off or ingenuine. Almost like it's a "factory-made" movie rather than something hand-crafted.

                        I didn't care about the characters. There are lots of stupid moments and things that make you raise an eyebrow. The treasure hunting stuff feels so random like they are making it up on the spot. The comedy isn't terrible, it made me smirk a bunch of times. But I don't think I laughed one single time. And a few of the jokes are super cringe-y.
                        
                        The action is alright. I like crazy, outrageous action movies. But none of scenes impressed me. I think part of it is not caring about the characters, which drains the tension. And the fight scenes are once again, for the millionth time, filled with quick-cuts and close-ups so you can't see. When will they learn?
                        
                        I really wish movies would go for the R rating more often. But if you're going to go with PG-13, please stop trying to show (but not show) things that should be in a rated R movie. For example, if someone's throat is slit, don't blatantly cut away at the last second. And then continue to show that person multiple times, with ZERO blood coming out. It makes the movie feel amateur.
                        
                        On four occasions I thought to myself, "Look, Tom Holland is Spider-Man-ing." And it's not because I can't see the actor in any other role. He is very different in Cherry. But things he said sounded exactly like something Peter Parker would say, and things he did looked exactly like Spider-Man would do them. At one point I wondered if they were doing it on purpose. Odd. (1 viewing, opening night IMAX 2/17/2022)

                    <p>Obvious cgi, plot holes, and lack of character depth made uncharted fall in the kind of lame category. Some funny moments between Wahlberg and Holland and decent sets. It was just too unbelievable.

                    <p>When I first saw the trailer of the movie, I decided to watch it in theater. I never watched any movie of Adivi Sesh before.

                        I am very impressed with the storytelling, BCM, acting of each.
                        
                        Adivi has done justice to the character, not even once feel that he is acting. He is outstanding as Major Sandeep.
                        
                        From start to end movie keeps you engage. Though I feel movie could have been little short i.e. 10-15 mins.
                        
                        Direction, cinematography are world class. I think this movie is better than any Hollywood action movie.
                        
                        Please go and watch with your family. This movie deserve support.</p>
